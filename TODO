Here is the list of things that needs to be done:

Data structures
---------------
- heap
- priority queue
- B-tree (working on it)
- AVL tree
- various graph interpretations


Algorithms
----------
(graph)
- Dijsktra's algorithm
- Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm

Others
------
- reference counting (a'la kref in Linux kernel)

Permutations
------------
- next permutation
- permutation to index and vice versa
